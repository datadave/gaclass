# Project Idea

What is the topic you'd like to explore? 
The value of data-backed product placement decisions within Instagram feeds of highly followed accounts

Why is this topic personally important to you? What is it about the topic that most fascinates you? 
I have a friend that is an "agent" of Instagram "celebs." As a data analyst supportig the e-tail industry, I'm aware of how these companies make branding spend decisions and how much they're willing to pay for increased efficiencies.  I think this would be an interesting business model to dig into.

What is the question, or what are the main questions, that you'd like to answer about this topic?
What is the "eyeball" value of a given instagram handle feed?
Is there a measurable difference in demographic / behavioral / psychographic / geographic profiles between each handle's audiences?
Are different types of product photos viewed differently?  (Integrated vs. Promotional)

What are the types of available data relevant to your questions?
Instagram Data (Scraped)
3rd party user data (from Rocket Fuel)

Beyond the community of this classroom, whom are the other audiences that you might like to reach with the results of this project?
- E-tailers / Retailers
- Successful Instagram'ers
- Agents of Successful Instagram'ers
